##### Hi, the picture you have seen in my profile comes from [Fernando Alonso][2]'s Instagram. He names this toy 'Tomita'. Each time Fernando took part in F1 Grand Prix around the world in 2012,he always took beautiful photos for Tomita,which made Tomita famous among Fer's fans. This photo was token in The Bund of Shanghai.
